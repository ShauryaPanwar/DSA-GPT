An A-Z of useful Python tricks,n A-Z of useful Python trick,"Python is one of the world’s most popular, in-demand programming languages. This is for many reasons: I use Python daily as an integral part of my job as a data scientist. Along the way, I’ve picked up a few useful tricks and tips. Here, I’ve made an attempt at sharing some of them in an A-Z format. Most of these ‘tricks’ are things I’ve used or stumbled upon during my day-to-day work. Some I found while browsing the  Python Standard Library docs . A few others I found searching through  PyPi . However, credit where it is due — I discovered four or five of them over at  awesome-python.com . This is a curated list of hundreds of interesting Python tools and modules. It is worth browsing for inspiration! One of the many reasons why Python is such a popular language is because it is readable and expressive. It is often joked that Python is ‘ executable pseudocode ’. But when you can write code like this, it’s difficult to argue otherwise: You want to plot graphs in the console? You can have graphs in the console. Python has some great default datatypes, but sometimes they just won’t behave exactly how you’d like them to. Luckily, the Python Standard Library offers  the collections module . This handy add-on provides you with further datatypes. Ever wondered how you can look inside a Python object and see what attributes it has? Of course you have. From the command line: This can be a really useful feature when running Python interactively, and for dynamically exploring objects and modules you are working with. Read more  here . Yes,  really . Don’t pretend you’re not gonna try it out… 👍 One consequence of Python’s popularity is that there are always new versions under development. New versions mean new features — unless your version is out-of-date. Fear not, however. The  __future__ module  lets you import functionality from future versions of Python. It’s literally like time travel, or magic, or something. Why not have a go  importing curly braces ? Geography can be a challenging terrain for programmers to navigate (ha, a pun!). But  the geopy module  makes it unnervingly easy. It works by abstracting the APIs of a range of different geocoding services. It enables you to obtain a place’s full street address, latitude, longitude, and even altitude. There’s also a useful distance class. It calculates the distance between two locations in your favorite unit of measurement. Stuck on a coding problem and can’t remember that solution you saw before? Need to check StackOverflow, but don’t want to leave the terminal? Then you need  this useful command line tool . Ask it whatever question you have, and it’ll do its best to return an answer. Be aware though — it scrapes code from top answers from StackOverflow. It might not always give the most helpful information… Python’s  inspect module  is great for understanding what is happening behind the scenes. You can even call its methods on itself! The code sample below uses  inspect.getsource()  to print its own source code. It also uses  inspect.getmodule()  to print the module in which it was defined. The last line of code prints out its own line number. Of course, beyond these trivial uses, the inspect module can prove useful for understanding what your code is doing. You could also use it for writing self-documenting code. The Jedi library is an autocompletion and code analysis library. It makes writing code quicker and more productive. Unless you’re developing your own IDE, you’ll probably be most interested in  using Jedi as an editor plugin . Luckily, there are already loads available! You may already be using Jedi, however. The IPython project makes use of Jedi for its code autocompletion functionality. When learning any language, there are many milestones along the way. With Python, understanding the mysterious  **kwargs  syntax probably counts as one. The double-asterisk in front of a dictionary object lets you pass the contents of that dictionary as  named arguments to a function . The dictionary’s keys are the argument names, and the values are the values passed to the function. You don’t even need to call it  kwargs ! This is useful when you want to write functions that can handle named arguments not defined in advance. One of my favourite things about programming in Python are its  list comprehensions . These expressions make it easy to write very clean code that reads almost like natural language. You can read more about how to use them  here . Python supports functional programming through a number of inbuilt features. One of the most useful is the  map()  function — especially in combination with  lambda functions . In the example above,  map()  applies a simple lambda function to each element in  x . It returns a map object, which can be converted to some iterable object such as a list or tuple. If you haven’t seen it already, then be prepared to have your mind blown by  Python’s newspaper module . It lets you retrieve news articles and associated meta-data from a range of leading international publications. You can retrieve images, text and author names. It even has some  inbuilt NLP functionality . So if you were thinking of using BeautifulSoup or some other DIY webscraping library for your next project, save yourself the time and effort and  $ pip install newspaper3k  instead. Python provides support for  operator overloading , which is one of those terms that make you sound like a legit computer scientist. It’s actually a simple concept. Ever wondered why Python lets you use the  +  operator to add numbers and also to concatenate strings? That’s operator overloading in action. You can define objects which use Python’s standard operator symbols in their own specific way. This lets you use them in contexts relevant to the objects you’re working with. Python’s default  print  function does its job. But try printing out any large, nested object, and the result is rather ugly. Here’s where the  Standard Library’s pretty-print module  steps in. This prints out complex structured objects in an easy-to-read format. A must-have for any Python developer who works with non-trivial data structures. Python supports multithreading, and this is facilitated by the Standard Library’s Queue module. This module lets you implement queue data structures. These are data structures that let you add and retrieve entries according to a specific rule. ‘First in, first out’ (or FIFO) queues let you retrieve objects in the order they were added. ‘Last in, first out’ (LIFO) queues let you access the most recently added objects first. Finally, priority queues let you retrieve objects according to the order in which they are sorted. Here’s an example of how to use queues  for multithreaded programming in Python. When defining a class or an object in Python, it is useful to provide an ‘official’ way of representing that object as a string. For example: This makes debugging code a lot easier. Add it to your class definitions as below: Python makes a great scripting language. Sometimes using the standard os and subprocess libraries can be a bit of a headache. The  sh library  provides a neat alternative. It lets you call any program as if it were an ordinary function — useful for automating workflows and tasks, all from within Python. Python is a dynamically-typed language. You don’t need to specify datatypes when you define variables, functions, classes etc. This allows for rapid development times. However, there are few things more annoying than a runtime error caused by a simple typing issue. Since Python 3.5 , you have the option to provide type hints when defining functions. You can also define type aliases: Although not compulsory, type annotations can make your code easier to understand. They also allow you to use type checking tools to catch those stray TypeErrors before runtime. Probably worthwhile if you are working on large, complex projects! A quick and easy way to generate Universally Unique IDs (or ‘UUIDs’) is through the  Python Standard Library’s uuid module . This creates a randomized 128-bit number that will almost certainly be unique. In fact, there are over 2¹²² possible UUIDs that can be generated. That’s over five undecillion (or 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). The probability of finding duplicates in a given set is extremely low. Even with a trillion UUIDs, the probability of a duplicate existing is much, much less than one-in-a-billion. Pretty good for two lines of code. This is probably my favorite Python thing of all. Chances are you are working on multiple Python projects at any one time. Unfortunately, sometimes two projects will rely on different versions of the same dependency. Which do you install on your system? Luckily, Python’s  support for virtual environments  lets you have the best of both worlds. From the command line: Now you can have standalone versions and installations of Python running on the same machine. Sorted! Wikipedia has a great API that allows users programmatic access to an unrivalled body of completely free knowledge and information. The  wikipedia module  makes accessing this API almost embarrassingly convenient. Like the real site, the module provides support for multiple languages, page disambiguation, random page retrieval, and even has a  donate()  method. Humour is a key feature of the Python language — after all, it is named after the British comedy sketch show  Monty Python’s Flying Circus . Much of Python’s official documentation references the show’s most famous sketches. The sense of humour isn’t restricted to the docs, though. Have a go running the line below: Never change, Python. Never change. YAML stands for ‘ YAML Ain’t Markup Language ’. It is a data formatting language, and is a superset of JSON. Unlike JSON, it can store more complex objects and refer to its own elements. You can also write comments, making it particularly suited to writing configuration files. The  PyYAML module  lets you use YAML with Python. Install with: And then import into your projects: PyYAML lets you store Python objects of any datatype, and instances of any user-defined classes also. One last trick for ya, and it really is a cool one. Ever needed to form a dictionary out of two lists? The  zip()  inbuilt function takes a number of iterable objects and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple groups the elements of the input objects by their positional index. You can also ‘unzip’ objects by calling  *zip()  on them. So there you have it, an A-Z of Python tricks — hopefully you’ve found something useful for your next project. Python’s a very diverse and well-developed language, so there’s bound to be many features I haven’t got round to including. Please share any of your own favorite Python tricks by leaving a response below!"
Learning Python: From Zero to Hero,earning Python: From Zero to Her,"This post was originally published at  TK's Blog . First of all, what is Python? According to its creator, Guido van Rossum, Python is a: “high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code.” For me, the first reason to learn Python was that it is, in fact, a beautiful   programming language. It was really natural to code in it and express my thoughts. Another reason was that we can use coding in Python in multiple ways: data science, web development, and machine learning all shine here. Quora, Pinterest and Spotify all use Python for their backend web development. So let’s learn a bit about it. You can think about variables as words that store a value. Simple as that. In Python, it is really easy to define a variable and set a value to it. Imagine you want to store number 1 in a variable called “one.” Let’s do it: How simple was that? You just assigned the value 1 to the variable “one.” And you can assign any other  value  to whatever other  variables  you want. As you see in the table above, the variable “ two ” stores the integer  2 , and “ some_number ” stores  10,000 . Besides integers, we can also use booleans (True / False), strings, float, and so many other data types. “ If ” uses an expression to evaluate whether a statement is True or False. If it is True, it executes what is inside the “if” statement. For example: 2  is greater than  1 , so the “ print ” code is executed. The “ else ” statement will be executed if the “ if ” expression is  false . 1  is not greater than  2 , so the code inside the “ else ” statement will be executed. You can also use an “ elif ” statement: In Python, we can iterate in different forms. I’ll talk about two:  while   and  for . While  Looping: while the statement is True, the code inside the block will be executed. So, this code will print the number from  1  to  10 . The  while  loop needs a “ loop condition. ” If it stays True, it continues iterating. In this example, when  num  is  11  the  loop condition  equals  False . Another basic bit of code to better understand it: The  loop condition  is  True  so it keeps iterating — until we set it to  False . For Looping : you apply the variable “ num ” to the block, and the “ for ” statement will iterate it for you. This code will print the same as  while  code: from  1  to  10 . See? It is so simple. The range starts with  1  and goes until the  11 th element ( 10  is the  10 th element). Imagine you want to store the integer 1 in a variable. But maybe now you want to store 2. And 3, 4, 5 … Do I have another way to store all the integers that I want, but not in  millions of variables ? You guessed it — there is indeed another way to store them. List  is a collection that can be used to store a list of values (like these integers that you want). So let’s use it: It is really simple. We created an array and stored it on  my_integer . But maybe you are asking: “How can I get a value from this array?” Great question.  List  has a concept called  index . The first element gets the index 0 (zero). The second gets 1, and so on. You get the idea. To make it clearer, we can represent the array and each element with its index. I can draw it: Using the Python syntax, it’s also simple to understand: Imagine that you don’t want to store integers. You just want to store strings, like a list of your relatives’ names. Mine would look something like this: It works the same way as integers. Nice. We just learned how  Lists  indices work. But I still need to show you how we can add an element to the  List  data structure (an item to a list). The most common method to add a new value to a  List  is  append . Let’s see how it works: append  is super simple. You just need to apply the element (eg. “ The Effective Engineer ”) as the  append  parameter. Well, enough about  Lists .  Let’s talk about another data structure. Now we know that  Lists  are indexed with integer numbers. But what if we don’t want to use integer numbers as indices? Some data structures that we can use are numeric, string, or other types of indices. Let’s learn about the  Dictionary  data structure.  Dictionary  is a collection of key-value pairs. Here’s what it looks like: The  key  is the index pointing to the   value . How do we access the  Dictionary   value ? You guessed it — using the  key . Let’s try it: I created a  Dictionary  about me. My name, nickname, and nationality. Those attributes are the  Dictionary   keys . As we learned how to access the  List  using index, we also use indices ( keys  in the  Dictionary  context) to access the  value  stored in the  Dictionary . In the example, I printed a phrase about me using all the values stored in the  Dictionary . Pretty simple, right? Another cool thing about  Dictionary  is that we can use anything as the value. In the  Dictionary   I created, I want to add the  key  “age” and my real integer age in it: Here we have a  key  (age)  value  (24) pair using string as the  key  and integer as the  value . As we did with  Lists , let’s learn how to add elements to a  Dictionary . The  key   pointing to a   value  is a big part of what  Dictionary  is. This is also true when we are talking about adding elements to it: We just need to assign a  value  to a  Dictionary   key . Nothing complicated here, right? As we learned in the  Python Basics , the  List  iteration is very simple. We  Python   developers commonly use  For  looping. Let’s do it: So for each book in the bookshelf, we ( can do everything with it ) print it. Pretty simple and intuitive. That’s Python. For a hash data structure, we can also use the  for  loop, but we apply the  key  : This is an example how to use it. For each  key  in the  dictionary  , we  print  the  key  and its corresponding  value . Another way to do it is to use the  iteritems  method. We did name the two parameters as  key  and  value , but it is not necessary. We can name them anything. Let’s see it: We can see we used attribute as a parameter for the  Dictionary   key , and it works properly. Great! Objects  are a representation of real world objects like cars, dogs, or bikes. The objects share two main characteristics:  data  and  behavior . Cars have  data,  like number of wheels, number of doors, and seating capacity They also exhibit  behavior : they can accelerate, stop, show how much fuel is left, and so many other things. We identify  data  as  attributes  and  behavior  as  methods  in object-oriented programming. Again: Data → Attributes and Behavior → Methods And a  Class  is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In the real world, we often find many objects with the same type. Like cars. All the same make and model (and all have an engine, wheels, doors, and so on). Each car was built from the same set of blueprints and has the same components. Python, as an Object-Oriented programming language, has these concepts:  class  and  object . A class is a blueprint, a model for its objects. So again, a class it is just a model, or a way to define  attributes  and  behavior  (as we talked about in the theory section). As an example, a vehicle  class  has its own  attributes  that define what  objects  are vehicles. The number of wheels, type of tank, seating capacity, and maximum velocity are all attributes of a vehicle. With this in mind, let’s look at Python syntax for  classes : We define classes with a  class statement —  and that’s it. Easy, isn’t it? Objects  are instances of a  class . We create an instance by naming the class. Here  car  is an  object  (or instance) of the  class   Vehicle . Remember that our vehicle  class  has four  attributes : number of wheels, type of tank, seating capacity, and maximum velocity. We set all these  attributes  when creating a vehicle  object . So here, we define our  class  to receive data when it initiates it: We use the  init   method . We call it a constructor method. So when we create the vehicle  object , we can define these  attributes . Imagine that we love the  Tesla Model S,  and we want to create this kind of  object . It has four wheels, runs on electric energy, has space for five seats, and the maximum velocity is 250km/hour (155 mph). Let’s create this  object: Four wheels + electric “tank type” + five seats + 250km/hour maximum speed. All attributes are set. But how can we access these attributes’ values? We  send a message to the object asking about them . We call it a  method . It’s the  object’s behavior . Let’s implement it: This is an implementation of two methods:  number_of_wheels  and  set_number_of_wheels . We call it  getter  &  setter . Because the first gets the attribute value, and the second sets a new value for the attribute. In Python, we can do that using  @property  ( decorators ) to define  getters  and  setters . Let’s see it with code: And we can use these methods as attributes: This is slightly different than defining methods. The methods work as attributes. For example, when we set the new number of wheels, we don’t apply two as a parameter, but set the value 2 to  number_of_wheels . This is one way to write  pythonic   getter  and  setter  code. But we can also use methods for other things, like the “ make_noise ” method. Let’s see it: When we call this method, it just returns a string  “ VRRRRUUUUM. ” Encapsulation is a mechanism that restricts direct access to objects’ data and methods. But at the same time, it facilitates operation on that data (objects’ methods). “Encapsulation can be used to hide data members and members function. Under this definition, encapsulation means that the internal representation of an  object  is generally hidden from view outside of the object’s definition.” — Wikipedia All internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside. Only the object can interact with its internal data. First, we need to understand how  public  and  non-public  instance variables and methods work. For a Python class, we can initialize a  public instance variable  within our constructor method. Let’s see this: Within the constructor method: Here we apply the  first_name  value as an argument to the  public instance variable . Within the class: Here, we do not need to apply the  first_name  as an argument, and all instance objects will have a  class attribute  initialized with  TK . Cool. We have now learned that we can use  public instance variables  and  class attributes . Another interesting thing about the  public  part is that we can manage the variable value. What do I mean by that? Our  object  can manage its variable value:  Get  and  Set  variable values. Keeping the  Person  class in mind, we want to set another value to its  first_name  variable: There we go. We just set another value ( kaio ) to the  first_name  instance variable and it updated the value. Simple as that. Since it’s a  public  variable, we can do that. We don’t use the term “private” here, since no attribute is really private in Python (without a generally unnecessary amount of work). —  PEP 8 As the  public instance variable  , we can define the  non-public instance variable  both within the constructor method or within the class. The syntax difference is: for  non-public instance variables  , use an underscore ( _ ) before the  variable  name. “‘Private’ instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g.  _spam ) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member)” —  Python Software Foundation Here’s an example: Did you see the  email  variable? This is how we define a  non-public variable  : We can access and update it.  Non-public variables  are just a convention and should be treated as a non-public part of the API. So we use a method that allows us to do it inside our class definition. Let’s implement two methods ( email  and  update_email ) to understand it: Now we can update and access  non-public variables  using those methods. Let’s see: With  public methods , we can also use them out of our class: Let’s test it: Great — we can use it without any problem. But with  non-public methods  we aren’t able to do it. Let’s implement the same  Person  class, but now with a  show_age   non-public method  using an underscore ( _ ). And now, we’ll try to call this  non-public method  with our object: We can access and update it.  Non-public methods  are just a convention and should be treated as a non-public part of the API. Here’s an example for how we can use it: Here we have a  _get_age   non-public method  and a  show_age   public method . The  show_age  can be used by our object (out of our class) and the  _get_age  only used inside our class definition (inside  show_age  method). But again: as a matter of convention. With encapsulation we can ensure that the internal representation of the object is hidden from the outside. Certain objects have some things in common: their behavior and characteristics. For example, I inherited some characteristics and behaviors from my father. I inherited his eyes and hair as characteristics, and his impatience and introversion as behaviors. In object-oriented programming, classes can inherit common characteristics (data) and behavior (methods) from another class. Let’s see another example and implement it in Python. Imagine a car. Number of wheels, seating capacity and maximum velocity are all attributes of a car. We can say that an   ElectricCar  class inherits these same attributes from the regular  Car  class. Our  Car  class implemented: Once initiated, we can use all  instance variables  created. Nice. In Python, we apply a  parent class  to the  child class  as a parameter. An  ElectricCar  class can inherit from our  Car  class. Simple as that. We don’t need to implement any other method, because this class already has it (inherited from  Car  class). Let’s prove it: Beautiful. We learned a lot of things about Python basics: Congrats! You completed this dense piece of content about Python.

How to build your own Neural Network from scratch in Python,ow to build your own Neural Network from scratch in Pytho,"Update : When I wrote this article a year ago, I did not expect it to be  this  popular. Since then, this article has been viewed more than 450,000 times, with more than 30,000 claps. It has also made it to the front page of Google, and it is among the first few search results for ‘ Neural Network ’. Many of you have reached out to me, and I am deeply humbled by the impact of this article on your learning journey. This article also caught the eye of the editors at Packt Publishing. Shortly after this article was published, I was offered to be the sole author of the book  Neural Network Projects with Python .  Today, I am happy to share with you that my book has been published! The book is a continuation of this article, and it covers end-to-end implementation of neural network projects in areas such as face recognition, sentiment analysis, noise removal etc. Every chapter features a unique neural network architecture, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory Nets and Siamese Neural Networks. If you’re looking to create a strong machine learning portfolio with deep learning projects, do consider getting the book! You can get the book from Amazon:  Neural Network Projects with Python Motivation:  As part of my personal journey to gain a better understanding of Deep Learning, I’ve decided to build a Neural Network from scratch without a deep learning library like TensorFlow. I believe that understanding the inner workings of a Neural Network is important to any aspiring Data Scientist. This article contains what I’ve learned, and hopefully it’ll be useful for you as well! Most introductory texts to Neural Networks brings up brain analogies when describing them. Without delving into brain analogies, I find it easier to simply describe Neural Networks as a mathematical function that maps a given input to a desired output. Neural Networks consist of the following components The diagram below shows the architecture of a 2-layer Neural Network ( note that the input layer is typically excluded when counting the number of layers in a Neural Network ) Creating a Neural Network class in Python is easy. Training the Neural Network The output  ŷ  of a simple 2-layer Neural Network is: You might notice that in the equation above, the weights  W  and the biases  b  are the only variables that affects the output  ŷ. Naturally, the right values for the weights and biases determines the strength of the predictions. The process of fine-tuning the weights and biases from the input data is known as  training the Neural Network. Each iteration of the training process consists of the following steps: The sequential graph below illustrates the process. As we’ve seen in the sequential graph above, feedforward is just simple calculus and for a basic 2-layer neural network, the output of the Neural Network is: Let’s add a feedforward function in our python code to do exactly that. Note that for simplicity, we have assumed the biases to be 0. However, we still need a way to evaluate the “goodness” of our predictions (i.e. how far off are our predictions)? The  Loss Function  allows us to do exactly that. There are many available loss functions, and the nature of our problem should dictate our choice of loss function. In this tutorial, we’ll use a simple  sum-of-sqaures error  as our loss function. That is, the sum-of-squares error is simply the sum of the difference between each predicted value and the actual value. The difference is squared so that we measure the absolute value of the difference. Our goal in training is to find the best set of weights and biases that minimizes the loss function. Now that we’ve measured the error of our prediction (loss), we need to find a way to  propagate  the error back, and to update our weights and biases. In order to know the appropriate amount to adjust the weights and biases by, we need to know the  derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases . Recall from calculus that the derivative of a function is simply the slope of the function. If we have the derivative, we can simply update the weights and biases by increasing/reducing with it(refer to the diagram above). This is known as  gradient descent . However, we can’t directly calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases because the equation of the loss function does not contain the weights and biases. Therefore, we need the  chain rule  to help us calculate it. Phew! That was ugly but it allows us to get what we needed — the derivative (slope) of the loss function with respect to the weights, so that we can adjust the weights accordingly. Now that we have that, let’s add the backpropagation function into our python code. For a deeper understanding of the application of calculus and the chain rule in backpropagation, I strongly recommend this tutorial by 3Blue1Brown. Now that we have our complete python code for doing feedforward and backpropagation, let’s apply our Neural Network on an example and see how well it does. Our Neural Network should learn the ideal set of weights to represent this function. Note that it isn’t exactly trivial for us to work out the weights just by inspection alone. Let’s train the Neural Network for 1500 iterations and see what happens. Looking at the loss per iteration graph below, we can clearly see the loss  monotonically decreasing towards a minimum.  This is consistent with the gradient descent algorithm that we’ve discussed earlier. Let’s look at the final prediction (output) from the Neural Network after 1500 iterations. We did it! Our feedforward and backpropagation algorithm trained the Neural Network successfully and the predictions converged on the true values. Note that there’s a slight difference between the predictions and the actual values. This is desirable, as it prevents  overfitting  and allows the Neural Network to  generalize  better to unseen data. Fortunately for us, our journey isn’t over. There’s still  much  to learn about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. For example: I’ll be writing more on these topics soon, so do follow me on Medium and keep and eye out for them! I’ve certainly learnt a lot writing my own Neural Network from scratch. Although Deep Learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras makes it easy to build deep nets without fully understanding the inner workings of a Neural Network, I find that it’s beneficial for aspiring data scientist to gain a deeper understanding of Neural Networks. This exercise has been a great investment of my time, and I hope that it’ll be useful for you as well!"
Why Python is not the programming language of the future,hy Python is not the programming language of the futur,"It  took the programming community a couple of decades to appreciate Python. But since the early 2010’s, it has been booming — and eventually surpassing C, C#, Java and JavaScript in popularity. But until when will that trend continue? When will Python eventually be replaced by other languages, and why? Putting an exact expiry date on Python would be so much speculation, it might as well pass as Science-Fiction. Instead, I will assess the virtues that are boosting Python’s popularity right now, and the weak points that will break it in the future. Python’s success is reflected in the  Stack Overflow trends , which measure the count of tags in posts on the platform. Given the size of StackOverflow, this is quite a good indicator for language popularity. While R has been plateauing over the last few years, and many other languages are on a steady decline, Python’s growth seems unstoppable. Almost 14% of all StackOverflow questions are tagged “python”, and the trend is going up. And there are several reasons for that. Python has been around since the nineties. That doesn’t only mean that it has had plenty of time to grow. It has also acquired a large and supportive community. So if you have any issue while you’re coding in Python, the odds are high that you’ll be able to solve it with a single Google search. Simply because somebody will have already encountered your problem and written something helpful about it. It’s not only the fact that it has been around for decades, giving programmers the time to make brilliant tutorials. More than that, the syntax of Python is very human-readable. For a start, there’s no need to specify the data type. You just declare a variable; Python will understand from the context whether it’s an integer, a float value, a boolean or something else. This is a huge edge for beginners. If you’ve ever had to program in C++, you know how frustrating it is your program won’t compile because you swapped a float for an integer. And if you’ve ever had to read Python and C++ code side-by-side, you’ll know how understandable Python is. Even though C++ was designed with English in mind, it’s a rather bumpy read compared to Python code. medium.com Since Python has been around for so long, developers have made a package for every purpose. These days, you can find a package for almost everything. Want to crunch numbers, vectors and matrices?  NumPy  is your guy.  Want to do calculations for tech and engineering? Use  SciPy .  Want to go big in data manipulation and analysis? Give  Pandas  a go. Want to start out with Artificial Intelligence? Why not use  Scikit-Learn . Whichever computational task you’re trying to manage, chances are that there is a Python package for it out there. This makes Python stay on top of recent developments, can be seen from the surge in Machine Learning over the past few years. Based on the previous elaborations, you could imagine that Python will stay on top of sh*t for ages to come. But like every technology, Python has its weaknesses. I will go through the most important flaws, one by one, and assess whether these are fatal or not. Python is slow. Like, really slow. On average, you’ll need about 2–10 times longer to complete a task with Python than with any other language. There are  various reasons  for that. One of them is that it’s dynamically typed — remember that you don’t need to specify data types like in other languages. This means that a lot of memory needs to be used, because the program needs to reserve enough space for each variable that it works in any case. And lots of memory usage translates to lots of computing time. Another reason is that Python can only execute one task at a time. This is a consequence of flexible datatypes — Python needs to make sure each variable has only one datatype, and parallel processes could mess that up. In comparison, your average web browser can run a dozen different threads at once. And there are some other theories around, too. But at the end of the day, none of the speed issues matter. Computers and servers have gotten so cheap that we’re talking about fractions of seconds. And the end user doesn’t really care whether their app loads in 0.001 or 0.01 seconds. medium.com Originally, Python was  dynamically scoped . This basically means that, to evaluate an expression, a compiler first searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions. The problem with dynamic scoping is that every expression needs to be tested in every possible context — which is tedious. That’s why most modern programming languages use static scoping. Python tried to transition to static scoping, but  messed it up . Usually, inner scopes — for example functions within functions — would be able to see  and  change outer scopes. In Python, inner scopes can only see outer scopes, but not change them. This leads to a lot of confusion. Despite all of the flexibility within Python, the usage of Lambdas is rather restrictive. Lambdas can only be expressions in Python, and not be statements. On the other hand, variable declarations and statements are always statements. This means that Lambdas cannot be used for them. This distinction between expressions and statements is rather arbitrary, and doesn’t occur in other languages. In Python, you use whitespaces and indentations to indicate different levels of code. This makes it optically appealing and intuitive to understand. Other languages, for example C++, rely more on braces and semicolons. While this might not be visually appealing and beginner-friendly, it makes the code a lot more maintainable. For bigger projects, this is a lot more useful. Newer languages like Haskell solve this problem: They rely on whitespaces, but offer an alternative syntax for those who wish to go without. As we’re witnessing the shift from desktop to smartphone, it’s clear that we need robust languages to build mobile software. But not many mobile apps are being developed with Python. That doesn’t mean that it can’t be done — there is a Python package called Kivy for this purpose. But Python wasn’t made with mobile in mind. So even though it might produce passable results for basic tasks, your best bet is to use a language that was created for mobile app development. Some widely used programming frameworks for mobile include React Native, Flutter, Iconic, and Cordova. To be clear, laptops and desktop computers should be around for many years to come. But since mobile has long surpassed desktop traffic, it’s safe to say that learning Python is not enough to become a seasoned all-round developer. A Python script isn’t compiled first and then executed. Instead, it compiles every time you execute it, so any coding error manifests itself at runtime. This leads to poor performance, time consumption, and the need for a lot of tests. Like,  a lot  of tests. This is great for beginners since testing teaches them a lot. But for seasoned developers, having to debug a complex program in Python makes them go awry. This lack of performance is the biggest factor that sets a timestamp on Python. towardsdatascience.com There are a few new competitors on the market of programming languages: While there are other languages on the market, Rust, Go, and Julia are the ones that fix weak patches of Python. All of these languages excel in yet-to-come technologies, most notably in Artificial Intelligence. While their market share is still small, as reflected in the number of StackOverflow tags, the trend for all of them is clear: upwards. Given the ubiquitous popularity of Python at the moment, it will surely take half a decade, maybe even a whole, for any of these new languages to replace it. Which of the languages it will be — Rust, Go, Julia, or a new language of the future — is hard to say at this point. But given the performance issues that are fundamental in the architecture of Python, one will inevitably take its spot."
What exactly can you do with Python? Here are Python’s 3 main applications.,hat exactly can you do with Python? Here are Python’s 3 main applications,"If you’re thinking of learning Python — or if you recently started learning it — you may be asking yourself: “What exactly can I use Python for?” Well that’s a tricky question to answer, because there are so many applications for Python. But over time, I have observed that there are 3 main popular applications for Python: Let’s talk about each of them in turn. Web frameworks that are based on Python like  Django  and  Flask  have recently become very popular for web development. These web frameworks help you create server-side code (backend code) in Python. That’s the code that runs on your server, as opposed to on users’ devices and browsers (front-end code). If you’re not familiar with the difference between backend code and front-end code, please see my footnote below. That’s because a web framework makes it easier to build common backend logic. This includes mapping different URLs to chunks of Python code, dealing with databases, and generating HTML files users see on their browsers. Django and Flask are two of the most popular Python web frameworks. I’d recommend using one of them if you’re just getting started. There’s an  excellent article  about this topic by Gareth Dwyer, so let me quote it here: <begin quote> Main contrasts: You should probably choose: </end quote> In other words, If you’re a beginner, Flask is probably a better choice because it has fewer components to deal with. Also, Flask is a better choice if you want more customization. On the other hand, if you’re looking to build something straight-forward, Django will probably let you get there faster. Now, if you’re looking to learn Django, I recommend the book called Django for Beginners. You can find it  here . You can also find the free sample chapters of that book  here . Okay, let’s go to the next topic! I think the best way to explain what machine learning is would be to give you a simple example. Let’s say you want to develop a program that automatically detects what’s in a picture. So, given this picture below (Picture 1), you want your program to recognize that it’s a dog. Given this other one below (Picture 2), you want your program to recognize that it’s a table. You might say, well, I can just write some code to do that. For example, maybe if there are a lot of light brown pixels in the picture, then we can say that it’s a dog. Or maybe, you can figure out how to detect edges in a picture. Then, you might say, if there are many straight edges, then it’s a table. However, this kind of approach gets tricky pretty quickly. What if there’s a white dog in the picture with no brown hair? What if the picture shows only the round parts of the table? This is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning typically implements an algorithm that automatically detects a pattern in the given input. You can give, say, 1,000 pictures of a dog and 1,000 pictures of a table to a machine learning algorithm. Then, it will learn the difference between a dog and a table. When you give it a new picture of either a dog or a table, it will be able to recognize which one it is. I think this is somewhat similar to how a baby learns new things. How does a baby learn that one thing looks like a dog and another a table? Probably from a bunch of examples. You probably don’t explicitly tell a baby, “If something is furry and has light brown hair, then it’s probably a dog.” You would probably just say, “That’s a dog. This is also a dog. And this one is a table. That one is also a table.” Machine learning algorithms work much the same way. You can apply the same idea to: among other applications. Popular machine learning algorithms you might have heard about include: You can use any of the above algorithms to solve the picture-labeling problem I explained earlier. There are popular machine learning libraries and frameworks for Python. Two of the most popular ones are  scikit-learn  and  TensorFlow . If you’re just getting started with a machine learning project, I would recommend that you first start with scikit-learn. If you start running into efficiency issues, then I would start looking into TensorFlow. To learn machine learning fundamentals, I would recommend either  Stanford’s  or  Caltech’s  machine learning course. Please note that you need basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra to understand some of the materials in those courses. Then, I would practice what you’ve learned from one of those courses with  Kaggle . It’s a website where people compete to build the best machine learning algorithm for a given problem. They have nice tutorials for beginners, too. To help you understand what these might look like, let me give you a simple example here. Let’s say you’re working for a company that sells some products online. Then, as a data analyst, you might draw a bar graph like this. From this graph, we can tell that men bought over 400 units of this product and women bought about 350 units of this product this particular Sunday. As a data analyst, you might come up with a few possible explanations for this difference. One obvious possible explanation is that this product is more popular with men than with women. Another possible explanation might be that the sample size is too small and this difference was caused just by chance. And yet another possible explanation might be that men tend to buy this product more only on Sunday for some reason. To understand which of these explanations is correct, you might draw another graph like this one. Instead of showing the data for Sunday only, we’re looking at the data for a full week. As you can see, from this graph, we can see that this difference is pretty consistent over different days. From this little analysis, you might conclude that the most convincing explanation for this difference is that this product is simply more popular with men than with women. On the other hand, what if you see a graph like this one instead? Then, what explains the difference on Sunday? You might say, perhaps men tend to buy more of this product only on Sunday for some reason. Or, perhaps it was just a coincidence that men bought more of it on Sunday. So, this is a simplified example of what data analysis might look like in the real world. The data analysis work I did when I was working at Google and Microsoft was very similar to this example — only more complex. I actually used Python at Google for this kind of analysis, while I used JavaScript at Microsoft. I used SQL at both of those companies to pull data from our databases. Then, I would use either Python and Matplotlib (at Google) or JavaScript and D3.js (at Microsoft) to visualize and analyze this data. One of the most popular libraries for data visualization is  Matplotlib . It’s a good library to get started with because: How should I learn data analysis / visualization with Python? You should first learn the fundamentals of data analysis and visualization. When I looked for good resources for this online, I couldn’t find any. So, I ended up making a YouTube video on this topic: I also ended up making a  full course on this topic on Pluralsight , which you can take for free by signing up to their 10-day free trial. I’d recommend both of them. After learning the fundamentals of data analysis and visualization, learning fundamentals of statistics from websites like Coursera and Khan Academy will be helpful, as well. Scripting usually refers to writing small programs that are designed to automate simple tasks. So, let me give you an example from my personal experience here. I used to work at a small startup in Japan where we had an email support system. It was a system for us to respond to questions customers sent us via email. When I was working there, I had the task of counting the numbers of emails containing certain keywords so we could analyze the emails we received. We could have done it manually, but instead, I wrote a simple program / simple script to automate this task. Actually, we used Ruby for this back then, but Python is also a good language for this kind of task. Python is suited for this type of task mainly because it has relatively simple syntax and is easy to write. It’s also quick to write something small with it and test it. I’m not an expert on embedded applications, but I know that Python works with Rasberry Pi. It seems like a popular application among hardware hobbyists. You could use the library called PyGame to develop games, but it’s not the most popular gaming engine out there. You could use it to build a hobby project, but I personally wouldn’t choose it if you’re serious about game development. Rather, I would recommend getting started with Unity with C#, which is one of the most popular gaming engines. It allows you to build a game for many platforms, including Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android. You could make one with Python using Tkinter, but it doesn’t seem like the most popular choice either. Instead, it seems like languages like  Java, C#, and C++  are more popular for this. Recently, some companies have started using JavaScript to create Desktop applications, too. For example, Slack’s desktop app was built with something called Electron . It allows you to build desktop applications with JavaScript. Personally, if I was building a desktop application, I would go with a JavaScript option. It allows you to reuse some of the code from a web version if you have it. However, I’m not an expert on desktop applications either, so please let me know in a comment if you disagree or agree with me on this. I would recommend Python 3 since it’s more modern and it’s a more popular option at this point. Let’s say you want to make something like Instagram. Then, you’d need to create front-end code for each type of device you want to support. You might use, for example: Each set of code will run on each type of device / browser. This will be the set of code that determines what the layout of the app will be like, what the buttons should look like when you click them, etc. However, you will still need the ability to store users’ info and photos. You will want to store them on your server and not just on your users’ devices so each user’s followers can view his/her photos. This is where the backend code / server-side code comes in. You’ll need to write some backend code to do things like: So, this is the difference between backend code and front-end code. By the way, Python is not the only good choice for writing backend / server-side code. There are many other popular choices, including Node.js, which is based on JavaScript. I have a programming education YouTube channel called  CS Dojo  with 440,000+ subscribers, where I produce more content like this article. For example, you might like these videos:"

It is pretty popular due to its innovative styles of teaching a foreign language. The concept is simple: five to ten minutes of interactive training a day is enough to learn a language."
Bye-bye Python. Hello Julia!,ye-bye Python. Hello Julia,"D on’t get me wrong. Python’s popularity is still backed by a rock-solid community of computer scientists, data scientists and AI specialists. But if you’ve ever been at a dinner table with these people, you also know how much they rant about the weaknesses of Python. From being slow to requiring excessive testing, to producing runtime errors despite prior testing — there’s enough to be pissed off about. Which is why more and more programmers are adopting other languages — the top players being Julia, Go, and Rust. Julia is great for mathematical and technical tasks, while Go is awesome for modular programs, and Rust is the top choice for systems programming. Since data scientists and AI specialists deal with lots of mathematical problems, Julia is the winner for them. And even upon critical scrutiny, Julia has upsides that Python can’t beat. towardsdatascience.com When people create a new programming language, they do so because they want to keep the good features of old languages and fix the bad ones. In this sense, Guido van Rossum created Python in the late 1980s to improve ABC. The latter was  too perfect  for a programming language — while its rigidity made it easy to teach, it was hard to use in real life. In contrast, Python is quite pragmatic. You can see this in the  Zen of Python , which reflects the intention that the creators have: Python still kept the good features of ABC: Readability, simplicity, and beginner-friendliness for example. But Python is far more robust and adapted to real life than ABC ever was. In the same sense, the creators of Julia want to keep the good parts of other languages and ditch the bad ones. But Julia is a lot more ambitious: instead of replacing one language, it wants to beat them all. This is how  Julia’s creators  say it: Julia wants to blend all upsides that currently exist, and not trade them off for the downsides in other languages. And even though Julia is a young language, it has already achieved a lot of the goals that the creators set. Julia can be used for everything from simple machine learning applications to enormous supercomputer simulations. To some extent, Python can do this, too — but Python somehow grew into the job. In contrast,  Julia was built  precisely for this stuff. From the bottom up. Julia’s creators wanted to make a language that is as fast as C — but what they created is  even faster . Even though Python has become easier to speed up in recent years, its performance is still a far cry from what Julia can do. In 2017, Julia even joined the  Petaflop Club  — the small club of languages who can exceed speeds of one petaflop per second at peak performance. Apart from Julia, only C, C++ and Fortran are  in the club  right now. towardsdatascience.com With its more than 30 years of age, Python has an enormous and supportive community. There is hardly a Python-related question that you can’t get answered within one Google search. In contrast, the Julia community is pretty tiny. While this means that you might need to dig a bit further to find an answer, you might link up with the same people again and again. And this can turn into programmer-relationships that are beyond value. You don’t even need to know a single Julia-command to code in Julia. Not only can you use Python and C code within Julia. You can even use  Julia within Python ! Needless to say, this makes it extremely easy to patch up the weaknesses of your Python code. Or to stay productive while you’re still getting to know Julia. This is one of the strongest points of Python — its zillion well-maintained libraries. Julia doesn’t have many libraries, and users have complained that they’re not amazingly maintained (yet). But when you consider that Julia is a very young language with a limited amount of resources, the number of libraries that they already have is pretty impressive. Apart from the fact that Julia’s amount of libraries is growing, it can also interface with libraries from C and Fortran to handle plots, for example. Python is 100% dynamically typed. This means that the program decides at runtime whether a variable is a float or an integer, for example. While this is extremely beginner-friendly, it also introduces a whole host of possible bugs. This means that you need to test Python code in all possible scenarios — which is quite a dumb task that takes a lot of time. Since the Julia-creators also wanted it to be easy to learn, Julia fully supports dynamical typing. But in contrast to Python, you can introduce static types if you like — in the way they are present in C or Fortran, for example. This can save you a ton of time: Instead of finding  excuses for not testing  your code, you can specify the type wherever it makes sense. towardsdatascience.com While all these things sound pretty great, it’s important to keep in mind that Julia is still tiny compared to Python. One pretty good metric is the number of questions on StackOverflow: At this point in time, Python is tagged about twenty more often than Julia! This doesn’t mean that Julia is unpopular — rather, it’s naturally taking some time to get adopted by programmers. Think about it — would you really want to write your whole code in a different language? No, you’d rather try a new language in some future project. This creates a time lag that every programming language faces between its release and its adoption. But if you adopt it now — which is easy because Julia allows an enormous amount of language conversion — you’re investing in the future. As more and more people adopt Julia, you’ll already have gained enough experience to answer their questions. Also, your code will be more durable as more and more Python code is replaced by Julia. Forty years ago, artificial intelligence was nothing but a niche phenomenon. The industry and investors didn’t believe in it, and many technologies were clunky and hard to use. But those who learned it back then are the giants of today — those that are so high in demand that  their salary  matches that of an NFL player. Similarly, Julia is still very niche now. But when it grows, the big winners will be those who adopted it early. I’m not saying that you’re guaranteed to make a shitload of money in ten years if you adopt Julia now. But you’re increasing your chances. Think about it: Most programmers out there have Python on their CV. And in the next few years, we’ll see even more Python programmers on the job market. But if the demand of enterprises for Python slows, the perspectives for Python programmers are going to go down. Slowly at first, but inevitably. On the other hand, you have a real edge if you can put Julia on your CV. Because let’s be honest, what distinguishes you from any other Pythonista out there? Not much. But there won’t be that many Julia-programmers out there, even in three years’ time. With Julia-skills, not only are you showing that you have interests beyond the job requirements. You’re also demonstrating that you’re eager to learn and that you have a broader sense of what it means to be a programmer. In other words, you’re fit for the job. You — and the other Julia programmers — are future rockstars, and you know it. Or, as  Julia’s creators  said it in 2012: Python is still insanely popular. But if you learn Julia now, that could be your golden ticket later on. In this sense: Bye-bye Python. Hello Julia! Edit: I’ve given a talk on Julia vs. Python! It was hosted by  Hatchpad , and the video is  here ."
The Next Level of Data Visualization in Python,he Next Level of Data Visualization in Pytho,"The sunk-cost fallacy is one of many  harmful cognitive biases  to which humans fall prey. It  refers to our tendency  to continue to devote time and resources to a lost cause because we have already spent — sunk — so much time in the pursuit. The sunk-cost fallacy applies to staying in bad jobs longer than we should, slaving away at a project even when it’s clear it won’t work, and yes, continuing to use a tedious, outdated plotting library — matplotlib — when more efficient, interactive, and better-looking alternatives exist. Over the past few months, I’ve realized the only reason I use  matplotlib  is the hundreds of hours I’ve sunk into learning the  convoluted syntax . This complication leads to hours of frustration on StackOverflow figuring out how to  format dates  or  add a second y-axis . Fortunately, this is a great time for Python plotting, and after exploring  the options , a clear winner — in terms of ease-of-use, documentation, and functionality — is the  plotly Python library.  In this article, we’ll dive right into  plotly , learning how to make better plots in less time — often with one line of code. All of the code for this article is  available on GitHub . The charts are all interactive and can be viewed on  NBViewer here . The  plotly   Python package is an open-source library built on  plotly.js  which  in turn is built on  d3.js .  We’ll be using a wrapper on plotly called  cufflinks  designed to work with Pandas dataframes. So, our entire stack is cufflinks > plotly > plotly.js > d3.js which means we get the efficiency of coding in Python with the incredible  interactive graphics capabilities of d3. ( Plotly itself  is a graphics company with several products and open-source tools. The Python library is free to use, and we can make unlimited charts in offline mode plus up to 25 charts in online mode to  share with the world .) All the work in this article was done in a Jupyter Notebook with plotly + cufflinks running in offline mode. After installing plotly and cufflinks with  pip install cufflinks plotly  import the following to run in Jupyter: Single variable — univariate — plots are a standard way to start an analysis and the histogram is a go-to plot ( although it has some issues ) for graphing a distribution. Here, using my Medium article statistics (you can see  how to get your own stats here  or use  mine here ) let’s make an interactive histogram of the number of claps for articles (  df  is a standard Pandas dataframe): For those used to  matplotlib , all we have to do is add one more letter (  iplot  instead of  plot ) and we get a much better-looking and interactive chart! We can click on the data to get more details, zoom into sections of the plot, and as we’ll see later, select different categories to highlight. If we want to plot overlaid histograms, that’s just as simple: With a little bit of  pandas  manipulation, we can do a barplot: s we saw, we can combine the  power of pandas  with plotly + cufflinks. For a boxplot of the fans per story by publication, we use a  pivot  and then plot: The benefits of interactivity are that we can explore and subset the data as we like. There’s a lot of information in a boxplot, and without the ability to see the numbers, we’ll miss most of it! The scatterplot is the heart of most analyses. It allows us to see the evolution of a variable over time or the relationship between two (or more) variables. A considerable portion of real-world data has a time element. Luckily, plotly + cufflinks was designed with time-series visualizations in mind. Let’s make a dataframe of my TDS articles and look at how the trends have changed. Here we are doing quite a few different things all in one line: For more information, we can also add in text annotations quite easily: For a two-variable scatter plot colored by a third categorical variable we use: Let’s get a little more sophisticated by using a log axis — specified as a plotly layout — (see the  Plotly documentation  for the layout specifics) and sizing the bubbles by a numeric variable: With a little more work ( see notebook for details ), we can even put four variables ( this is not advised ) on one graph! As before, we can combine pandas with plotly+cufflinks for useful plots See the notebook  or the documentation  for more examples of added functionality. We can add in text annotations, reference lines, and best-fit lines to our plots with a single line of code, and still with all the interaction. Now we’ll get into a few plots that you probably won’t use all that often, but which can be quite impressive. We’ll use the  plotly  figure_factory , to keep even these incredible plots to one line. When we want to explore relationships among many variables, a  scattermatrix  (also called a splom) is a great option: Even this plot is completely interactive allowing us to explore the data. To visualize the correlations between numeric variables, we calculate the correlations and then make an annotated heatmap: The list of plots goes on and on. Cufflinks also has several themes we can use to get completely different styling with no effort. For example, below we have a ratio plot in the “space” theme and a spread plot in “ggplot”: We also get 3D plots (surface and bubble): For those  who are so inclined , you can even make a pie chart: When you make these plots in the notebook, you’ll notice a small link on the lower right-hand side on the graph that says “Export to plot.ly”. If you click that link, you are then taken to the  chart studio  where you can touch up your plot for a final presentation. You can add annotations, specify the colors, and generally clean everything up for a great figure. Then, you can publish your figure online so anyone can find it with the link. Below are two charts I touched up in Chart Studio: With everything mentioned here, we are still not exploring the full capabilities of the library! I’d encourage you to check out both the plotly and the cufflinks documentation for more incredible graphics. The worst part about the sunk cost fallacy is you only realize how much time you’ve wasted after you’ve quit the endeavor. Fortunately, now that I’ve made the mistake of sticking with  matploblib  for too long, you don’t have to! When thinking about plotting libraries, there are a few things we want: As of right now, the best option for doing all of these in  Python is plotly . Plotly allows us to make visualizations quickly and helps us get better insight into our data through interactivity. Also, let’s admit it, plotting should be one of the most enjoyable parts of data science! With other libraries, plotting turned into a tedious task, but with plotly, there is again joy in making a great figure! Now that it’s 2019, it is time to upgrade your Python plotting library for better efficiency, functionality, and aesthetics in your data science visualizations. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter  @koehrsen_will."
A Complete Machine Learning Project Walk-Through in Python: Part One, Complete Machine Learning Project Walk-Through in Python: Part On,"Reading through a data science book or taking a course, it can feel like you have the individual pieces, but don’t quite know how to put them together. Taking the next step and solving a complete machine learning problem can be daunting, but preserving and completing a first project will give you the confidence to tackle any data science problem. This series of articles will walk through a complete machine learning solution with a real-world dataset to let you see how all the pieces come together. We’ll follow the general machine learning workflow step-by-step: Along the way, we’ll see how each step flows into the next and how to specifically implement each part in Python. The  complete project  is available on GitHub, with the  first notebook here.  This first article will cover steps 1–3 with the rest addressed in subsequent posts. (As a note, this problem was originally given to me as an “assignment” for a job screen at a start-up. After completing the work, I was offered the job, but then the CTO of the company quit and they weren’t able to bring on any new employees. I guess that’s how things go on the start-up scene!) The first step before we get coding is to understand the problem we are trying to solve and the available data. In this project, we will work with  publicly available building energy data  from New York City. The objective is to use the energy data to build a model that can predict the Energy Star Score of a building and interpret the results to find the factors which influence the score. The data includes the Energy Star Score, which makes this a supervised regression machine learning task: We want to develop a model that is both  accurate  — it can predict the Energy Star Score close to the true value — and  interpretable  — we can understand the model predictions. Once we know the goal, we can use it to guide our decisions as we dig into the data and build models. Contrary to what most data science courses would have you believe, not every dataset is a perfectly curated group of observations with no missing values or anomalies (looking at you  mtcars  and  iris  datasets). Real-world data is messy which means we need to  clean and wrangle  it into an acceptable format before we can even start the analysis. Data cleaning is an un-glamorous, but necessary part of most actual data science problems. First, we can load in the data as a Pandas  DataFrame  and take a look: This is a subset of the full data which contains 60 columns. Already, we can see a couple issues: first, we know that we want to predict the  ENERGY STAR Score  but we don’t know what any of the columns mean. While this isn’t necessarily an issue — we can often make an accurate model without any knowledge of the variables — we want to focus on interpretability, and it might be important to understand at least some of the columns. When I originally got the assignment from the start-up, I didn’t want to ask what all the column names meant, so I looked at the name of the file, and decided to search for “Local Law 84”. That led me to  this page  which explains this is an NYC law requiring all buildings of a certain size to report their energy use. More searching brought me to  all the definitions of the columns.  Maybe looking at a file name is an obvious place to start, but for me this was a reminder to go slow so you don’t miss anything important! We don’t need to study all of the columns, but we should at least understand the Energy Star Score, which is described as: A 1-to-100 percentile ranking based on self-reported energy usage for the reporting year. The  Energy Star score  is a relative measure used for comparing the energy efficiency of buildings. That clears up the first problem, but the second issue is that missing values are encoded as “Not Available”. This is a string in Python which means that even the columns with numbers will be stored as  object  datatypes because Pandas converts a column with any strings into a column of all strings. We can see the datatypes of the columns using the  dataframe.info() method: Sure enough, some of the columns that clearly contain numbers (such as ft²), are stored as objects. We can’t do numerical analysis on strings, so these will have to be converted to number (specifically  float ) data types! Here’s a little Python code that replaces all the “Not Available” entries with not a number (  np.nan ), which can be interpreted as numbers, and then converts the relevant columns to the  float  datatype: Once the correct columns are numbers, we can start to investigate the data. In addition to incorrect datatypes, another common problem when dealing with real-world data is missing values. These can arise for many reasons and have to be either filled in or removed before we train a machine learning model. First, let’s get a sense of how many missing values are in each column (see the  notebook for code ). (To create this table, I used a function from this  Stack Overflow Forum ). While we always want to be careful about removing information, if a column has a high percentage of missing values, then it probably will not be useful to our model. The threshold for removing columns should depend on the problem ( here is a discussion ), and for this project, we will remove any columns with more than 50% missing values. At this point, we may also want to remove outliers. These can be due to typos in data entry, mistakes in units, or they could be legitimate but extreme values. For this project, we will remove anomalies based on the  definition of extreme outliers : (For the code to remove the columns and the anomalies, see the notebook). At the end of the data cleaning and anomaly removal process, we are left with over 11,000 buildings and 49 features. Now that the tedious — but necessary — step of data cleaning is complete, we can move on to exploring our data!  Exploratory Data Analysis  (EDA) is an open-ended process where we calculate statistics and make figures to find trends, anomalies, patterns, or relationships within the data. In short, the goal of EDA is to learn what our data can tell us. It generally starts out with a high level overview, then narrows in to specific areas as we find interesting parts of the data. The findings may be interesting in their own right, or they can be used to inform our modeling choices, such as by helping us decide which features to use. The goal is to predict the Energy Star Score (renamed to  score  in our data) so a reasonable place to start is examining the distribution of this variable. A histogram is a simple yet effective way to visualize the distribution of a single variable and is easy to make using  matplotlib . This looks quite suspicious! The Energy Star score is a percentile rank, which means we would expect to see a uniform distribution, with each score assigned to the same number of buildings. However, a disproportionate number of buildings have either the highest, 100, or the lowest, 1, score (higher is better for the Energy Star score). If we go back to the definition of the score, we see that it is based on “self-reported energy usage” which might explain the very high scores. Asking building owners to report their own energy usage is like asking students to report their own scores on a test! As a result, this probably is not the most objective measure of a building’s energy efficiency. If we had an unlimited amount of time, we might want to investigate why so many buildings have very high and very low scores which we could by selecting these buildings and seeing what they have in common. However, our objective is only to predict the score and not to devise a better method of scoring buildings! We can make a note in our report that the scores have a suspect distribution, but our main focus in on predicting the score. A major part of EDA is searching for relationships between the features and the target. Variables that are correlated with the target are useful to a model because they can be used to predict the target. One way to examine the effect of a categorical variable (which takes on only a limited set of values) on the target is through a density plot using the  seaborn  library. A  density plot can be thought of as a smoothed histogram  because it shows the distribution of a single variable. We can color a density plot by class to see how a categorical variable changes the distribution. The following code makes a density plot of the Energy Star Score colored by the the type of building (limited to building types with more than 100 data points): We can see that the building type has a significant impact on the Energy Star Score. Office buildings tend to have a higher score while Hotels have a lower score. This tells us that we should include the building type in our modeling because it does have an impact on the target. As a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot encode the building type. A similar plot can be used to show the Energy Star Score by borough: The borough does not seem to have as large of an impact on the score as the building type. Nonetheless, we might want to include it in our model because there are slight differences between the boroughs. To quantify relationships between variables, we can use the  Pearson Correlation Coefficient . This is a measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A score of +1 is a perfectly linear positive relationship and a score of -1 is a perfectly negative linear relationship. Several values of the correlation coefficient are shown below: While the correlation coefficient cannot capture non-linear relationships, it is a good way to start figuring out how variables are related. In Pandas, we can easily calculate the correlations between any columns in a dataframe: The most negative (left) and positive (right) correlations with the target: There are several strong negative correlations between the features and the target with the most negative the different categories of EUI (these measures vary slightly in how they are calculated). The  EUI — Energy Use Intensity  — is the amount of energy used by a building divided by the square footage of the buildings. It is meant to be a measure of the efficiency of a building with a lower score being better. Intuitively, these correlations make sense: as the EUI increases, the Energy Star Score tends to decrease. To visualize relationships between two continuous variables, we use scatterplots. We can include additional information, such as a categorical variable, in the color of the points. For example, the following plot shows the Energy Star Score vs. Site EUI colored by the building type: This plot lets us visualize what a correlation coefficient of -0.7 looks like. As the Site EUI decreases, the Energy Star Score increases, a relationship that holds steady across the building types. The final exploratory plot we will make is known as the  Pairs Plot. This is a great exploration tool  because it lets us see relationships between multiple pairs of variables as well as distributions of single variables. Here we are using the seaborn visualization library and the  PairGrid  function to create a Pairs Plot with scatterplots on the upper triangle, histograms on the diagonal, and 2D kernel density plots and correlation coefficients on the lower triangle. To see interactions between variables, we look for where a row intersects with a column. For example, to see the correlation of  Weather Norm EUI  with  score , we look in the  Weather Norm EUI  row and the  score  column and see a correlation coefficient of -0.67. In addition to looking cool, plots such as these can help us decide which variables to include in modeling. Feature engineering and selection  often provide the greatest return on time invested in a machine learning problem. First of all, let’s define what these two tasks are: A machine learning model can only learn from the data we provide it, so ensuring that data includes all the relevant information for our task is crucial. If we don’t feed a model the correct data, then we are setting it up to fail and we should not expect it to learn! For this project, we will take the following feature engineering steps: One-hot encoding  is necessary to include categorical variables in a model. A machine learning algorithm cannot understand a building type of “office”, so we have to record it as a 1 if the building is an office and a 0 otherwise. Adding transformed features can help our model learn non-linear relationships within the data.  Taking the square root, natural log, or various powers of features  is common practice in data science and can be based on domain knowledge or what works best in practice. Here we will include the natural log of all numerical features. The following code selects the numeric features, takes log transformations of these features, selects the two categorical features, one-hot encodes these features, and joins the two sets together. This seems like a lot of work, but it is relatively straightforward in Pandas! After this process we have over 11,000 observations (buildings) with 110 columns (features). Not all of these features are likely to be useful for predicting the Energy Star Score, so now we will turn to feature selection to remove some of the variables. Many of the 110 features we have in our data are redundant because they are highly correlated with one another. For example, here is a plot of Site EUI vs Weather Normalized Site EUI which have a correlation coefficient of 0.997. Features that are strongly correlated with each other are known as  collinear  and removing one of the variables in these pairs of features can often help a  machine learning model generalize and be more interpretable . (I should point out we are talking about correlations of features with other features, not correlations with the target, which help our model!) There are a number of methods to calculate collinearity between features, with one of the most common the  variance inflation factor . In this project, we will use thebcorrelation coefficient to identify and remove collinear features. We will drop one of a pair of features if the correlation coefficient between them is greater than 0.6. For the implementation, take a look at the notebook (and  this Stack Overflow answer ) While this value may seem arbitrary, I tried several different thresholds, and this choice yielded the best model. Machine learning is an  empirical field  and is often about experimenting and finding what performs best! After feature selection, we are left with 64 total features and 1 target. We have now completed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. The final step to take before getting started with modeling is establishing a naive baseline. This is essentially a guess against which we can compare our results. If the machine learning models do not beat this guess, then we might have to conclude that machine learning is not acceptable for the task or we might need to try a different approach. For regression problems, a reasonable naive baseline is to guess the median value of the target on the training set for all the examples in the test set. This sets a relatively low bar for any model to surpass. The metric we will use is  mean absolute error  (mae)  which measures the average absolute error on the predictions. There are many metrics for regression, but I like  Andrew Ng’s advice  to pick a single metric and then stick to it when evaluating models. The mean absolute error is easy to calculate and is interpretable. Before calculating the baseline, we need to split our data into a training and a testing set: We will use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing: Now we can calculate the naive baseline performance: The naive estimate is off by about 25 points on the test set. The score ranges from 1–100, so this represents an error of 25%, quite a low bar to surpass! In this article we walked through the first three steps of a machine learning problem. After defining the question, we: Finally, we also completed the crucial step of establishing a baseline against which we can judge our machine learning algorithms. The second post ( available here ) will show how to evaluate machine learning models using  Scikit-Learn , select the best model, and perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model. The third post, dealing with model interpretation and reporting results,  is here . As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism and can be reached on Twitter  @koehrsen_will ."
Turn Python Scripts into Beautiful ML Tools,urn Python Scripts into Beautiful ML Tool,"In my experience, every nontrivial machine learning project is eventually stitched together with bug-ridden and unmaintainable internal tools. These tools — often a patchwork of Jupyter Notebooks and Flask apps — are difficult to deploy, require reasoning about client-server architecture, and don’t integrate well with machine learning constructs like Tensorflow GPU sessions. I saw this first at Carnegie Mellon, then at Berkeley, Google X, and finally while building autonomous robots at Zoox. These tools were often born as little Jupyter notebooks: the sensor calibration tool, the simulation comparison app, the LIDAR alignment app, the scenario replay tool, and so on. As a tool grew in importance, project managers stepped in. Processes sprouted. Requirements flowered. These solo projects gestated into scripts, and matured into gangly maintenance nightmares. When a tool became crucial, we  called in the tools team . They wrote fluent Vue and React. They blinged their laptops with stickers about declarative frameworks. They had a  design process : Which was awesome. But these tools all needed new features, like weekly. And the tools team was supporting ten other projects. They would say, “we’ll update your tool again in two months.” So we were back to building our own tools, deploying Flask apps, writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and trying to version control everything from notebooks to stylesheets. So my old Google X friend, Thiago Teixeira, and I began thinking about the following question:  What if we could make building tools as easy as writing Python scripts? We wanted machine learning engineers to be able to create beautiful apps without needing a tools team. These internal tools should arise as a natural byproduct of the ML workflow. Writing such tools should  feel  like training a neural net or performing an ad-hoc analysis in Jupyter! At the same time, we wanted to preserve all of the flexibility of a powerful app framework. We wanted to create beautiful, performant tools that engineers could show off. Basically, we wanted this: With an amazing beta community including engineers from Uber, Twitter, Stitch Fix, and Dropbox, we worked for a year to create  Streamlit , a  completely free and open source  app framework for ML engineers. With each prototype, the core principles of Streamlit became simpler and purer. They are: #1: Embrace Python scripting.  Streamlit apps are really just scripts that run from top to bottom. There’s no hidden state. You can factor your code with function calls. If you know how to write Python scripts, you can write Streamlit apps. For example, this is how you write to the screen: #2: Treat widgets as variables.  There are  no callbacks in Streamlit ! Every interaction simply reruns the script from top to bottom. This approach leads to really clean code: #3: Reuse data and computation.  What if you download lots of data or perform complex computation? The key is to  safely reuse  information across runs. Streamlit introduces a cache primitive that behaves like a persistent, immutable-by-default, data store that lets Streamlit apps safely and effortlessly reuse information. For example, this code  downloads data only once  from the  Udacity Self-driving car project , yielding a simple, fast app: In short, Streamlit works like this: Or in pictures: If this sounds intriguing, you can try it right now! Just run: This will automatically pop open a web browser pointing to your local Streamlit app. If not, just click the link. Ok. Are you back from playing with fractals? Those can be mesmerizing. The simplicity of these ideas does not prevent you from creating incredibly rich and useful apps with Streamlit. During my time at Zoox and Google X, I watched as self-driving car projects ballooned into gigabytes of visual data, which needed to be searched and understood, including running models on images to compare performance. Every self-driving car project I’ve seen eventually has had entire teams working on this tooling. Building such a tool in Streamlit is easy.  This Streamlit demo  lets you perform semantic search across the entire  Udacity self-driving car photo dataset , visualize human-annotated ground truth labels, and  run a complete neural net ( YOLO ) in real time  from within the app [1]. The whole app is a completely self-contained, 300-line Python script, most of which is machine learning code. In fact, there are  only 23 Streamlit calls in the whole app . You can run it yourself right now! As we worked with machine learning teams on their own projects, we came to realize that these simple ideas yield a number of important benefits: Streamlit apps are pure Python files.  So you can use your favorite editor and debugger with Streamlit. Pure Python scripts work seamlessly with Git  and other source control software, including commits, pull requests, issues, and comments. Because Streamlit’s underlying language is pure Python, you get all the benefits of these amazing collaboration tools for free 🎉. Streamlit provides an immediate-mode live coding environment.  Just click  Always rerun  when Streamlit detects a source file change. Caching simplifies setting up computation pipelines.  Amazingly, chaining cached functions automatically creates efficient computation pipelines! Consider  this code  adapted from our  Udacity demo : Basically, the pipeline is load_metadata → create_summary. Every time the script is run  Streamlit only recomputes whatever subset of the pipeline is required to get the right answer . Cool! Streamlit is built for GPUs.  Streamlit allows direct access to machine-level primitives like TensorFlow and PyTorch and complements these libraries. For example in this demo, Streamlit’s cache stores the entire  NVIDIA celebrity face GAN  [2]. This approach enables nearly instantaneous inference as the user updates sliders. Streamlit is a free and open-source library rather than a proprietary web app . You can serve Streamlit apps on-prem without contacting us. You can even run Streamlit locally on a laptop without an Internet connection! Furthermore, existing projects can adopt Streamlit incrementally. This just scratches the surface of what you can do with Streamlit. One of the most exciting aspects of Streamlit is how these primitives can be easily composed into complex apps that look like scripts. There’s a lot more we could say about how our architecture works and the features we have planned, but we’ll save that for future posts. We’re excited to finally share Streamlit with the community today and see what you all build with it. We hope that you’ll find it easy and delightful to turn your Python scripts into beautiful ML apps.
